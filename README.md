# Mayo Clinic – ER Patient Volume Forecasting

This repository provides a public overview of my work on a machine learning and data engineering project completed through an academic partnership with Mayo Clinic and Minnesota State University.

## Project Overview
The project focused on forecasting Emergency Room (ER) patient volumes and analyzing patient visit patterns using historical hospital data to support operational planning and resource planning.

## My Role
- Data Engineer & Machine Learning Contributor
- Preprocessed and analyzed ~94,000 patient records
- Engineered temporal features such as day of week, seasonality, and rolling averages
- Trained and evaluated machine learning models, including XGBoost
- Contributed to model evaluation, documentation, and presentation of results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Data visualization tools

## Results
- Built multiple forecasting models for ER patient volume
- XGBoost achieved the strongest predictive performance
- Feature engineering significantly improved forecasting accuracy

## Project Access
Due to healthcare data privacy regulations (HIPAA) and institutional restrictions, the original project repository and datasets are private and not publicly accessible.
